        //The general rules for naming variables are:
        //
        //	Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
        //	Names must begin with a letter
        //	Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
        //	Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
        //	Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "Myvar" are different variables)
        //	Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
